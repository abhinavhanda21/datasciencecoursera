##types of data science questions

descriptive - just description of data (you may describe a set of data but you are not saying what it might be for the next person)
exploratory - find realtionship you didn't know existed (you may discover a new connection but it can not be final say) 
inferential - use small sample of data to say something about bigger population (estimate of a quantity and uncertainity in the estimation) 
predictive - to use data on some object to predict values for another object(if x predicts y doesnt mean x causes y) 
casual - what happens when you change value of one variable how it will change value of other variable
mechanistic - to understand changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables of individual objects


##what is data
values of qualtitative and quantitative variable belonging to a set of items
-> data cant save you if you dont have question

##what is big data


##experimental design

1st formulate your question in advance
2nd statistical inference 
3rd confounding (what are the other variables causing realtionship)  Even if you observe that two variables are correlated with each other, you have to prove to yourself that they're not correlated because of some other variables we didn't measure.
